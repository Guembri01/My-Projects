## Completed Projects

### Project 1 -> In-Depth Analysis of Patient Satisfaction in the Medical Context

As part of my Master's in Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, I conducted an In-Depth Analysis of Patient Satisfaction in the Medical Context using methods such as PCA, CA, MCA, and classification techniques like K-means. Through these advanced analytical methods, I explored overall responses to a questionnaire.

In conclusion, this study highlights the crucial importance of certain aspects, such as the professionalism of caregivers, empathetic communication, and medical competence, in shaping patient satisfaction. These insights provide valuable avenues for improving healthcare delivery and strengthening the patient-caregiver relationship.

**Keywords:**
Learning preferences, PCA, CA, MCA, Classification.

This report aims to deepen the understanding of the determinants of patient satisfaction with healthcare by exploring the complex relationships between various variables. Through in-depth analyses, we seek to uncover the key factors that positively or negatively influence the patient experience in the medical context.

## Project 2 -> 3rd Place Winners - Airbnb and 2024 Olympics Hackathon

Our team won the 3rd prize at a hackathon focused on Airbnb and the 2024 Olympics. The challenge for participating teams was to propose enhancements to the Airbnb user experience by incorporating geographic analysis, natural language processing (NLP), and host profile studies. Our approach included understanding travelers' preferences based on location, past habits, and activities they enjoyed in a specific area, proposing experiences tailored to users' interests while considering factors such as weather, sports events, and tourist activities developed around them.

Additionally, we suggested implementing a search function based on natural language processing (NLP) to allow users to find accommodations using more natural and conversational queries. We also analyzed listing descriptions and user reviews to understand the most important features and amenities for each traveler, thereby refining search results accordingly. We extracted the requirements requested by tenants and performed sentiment analysis to categorize them based on their needs.

## Project 4 -> Top 5% in Kaggle Competition - House Price Prediction

Participated in a Kaggle competition to predict house prices in Ames, Iowa, using 79 explanatory variables. Ranked 471st, placing in the top 5% of competitors. Implemented data preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values and outliers, feature engineering, and used various advanced regression models. Additionally, applied stacking and blending techniques with models such as ElasticNet, Lasso, Ridge, SVR, GradientBoosting, XGBoost, and LightGBM for predictions.

## Project 5 -> Analysis and Model Selection for Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Prediction

The objective of this project is to develop accurate and robust predictive models to estimate the level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) from various clinical variables. PSA is a crucial biomarker for assessing the risk of prostate cancer. The data used comes from the study by Stamey et al. (1989) and includes variables such as the logarithm of cancer volume, the logarithm of prostate weight, age, and other relevant clinical characteristics.

The project begins with a data exploration phase, which includes visualizing distributions, checking for missing values, and normalizing variables to ensure data quality before modeling. Several techniques are then applied, including classical linear models, model selection methods, regularization techniques (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net), partial least squares regression (PLS), and principal component regression (PCR).

Each method is evaluated with different configurations to ensure model optimality. Cross-validation techniques are used to select the best hyperparameters and assess the predictive performance of each model. The goal is to compare these approaches to identify the most effective and applicable method in a clinical context for predicting PSA levels.

## Project 6 -> Comparison of Algorithms for Solving the N-Queens Problem in Artificial Intelligence

This study compares various algorithms to solve the N-Queens problem, a classic problem in artificial intelligence. The N-Queens problem involves placing N queens on an N × N chessboard such that no queen threatens another, according to the rules of chess. The problem is formalized as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP).

Objectives:

- Formalize the N-Queens problem as a CSP.
- Implement and compare the AC3 algorithm, depth-first search with backtracking, and the forward-checking algorithm.
- Analyze the results and draw conclusions.

## Project 7 -> Q-Learning Algorithm Implementation for Maze Solving

This project, part of the Master's program in Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, focuses on implementing the Q-learning algorithm to solve maze problems. The objective is to train an agent to find the shortest path between a starting point and an exit point in a maze while avoiding walls. The project involves creating the maze structure, defining states, actions, rewards, and algorithm parameters, training the agent using Q-learning, and validating its ability to find optimal paths in various maze configurations.

## Project 8 -> Decision-Making Tool Under Uncertainty: A Python Flask Web Application

This project, developed during my university studies, involved creating a web application using Python Flask to aid in decision-making under uncertainty. The tool allows users to input decision criteria and weights for each criterion. It then calculates the decision outcome using methods such as maximin, maximax, Laplace, Bernoulli, Hurwicz, and minimax regret. This enables users to compare results and make informed decisions.
